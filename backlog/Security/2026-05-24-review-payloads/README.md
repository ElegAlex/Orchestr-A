```

## Usage

### First session
1. Read `CLAUDE_SESSION_CONTRACT.md` end-to-end.
2. Read `BACKLOG.md` schema legend + Totals + Cross-validated subset table.
3. Pick the first Phase 1 task (recommendation: `SEC-001`, cross-validated and at the top of the deny-list for production safety).

### Every subsequent session
Apply the protocol in `CLAUDE_SESSION_CONTRACT.md`. One task per session, never auto-continue.

### CI integration
`scripts/check-backlog-coherence.sh` runs in GitHub Actions on every PR touching `BACKLOG.md`. It blocks PRs where DONE tasks have empty/invalid `Closed_by` SHAs or where the commit message does not contain `[closes <task-id>]`.

## Phase distribution

| Phase | Cluster | Title | Tasks |
| --- | --- | --- | ---: |
| 1 | mixed | Stop the bleed (prescribed blockers) | 7 |
| 2 | A | Audit log durcissement | 16 |
| 3 | F | Defense-in-depth schema — Invariants métier en SQL | 10 |
| 4 | B | RBAC complétude | 6 |
| 5 | K | Auth defense-in-depth | 12 |
| 6 | J | Upload / URL sinks | 8 |
| 7 | D | Mutations atomicity | 8 |
| 8 | C | Date / TZ unification | 7 |
| 9 | E | Hot paths : indexes + N+1 | 17 |
| 10 | G | Cascade vs conservation | 5 |
| 11 | H | Tests : suppression du théâtre | 12 |
| 12 | I | Frontend : couche données partagée | 7 |
| 13 | — | Findings hors cluster (parallèle) | 59 |
| **Total** | | | **174** |

## Cross-validated subset (highest confidence)

The following 7 findings were independently flagged by both Claude Code's adversarial review and OpenAI Codex's cross-review. Within their phase, prioritize these first.

- `SEC-001` — RBAC guard defaults to permissive mode
- `OBS-001` — Security audit events go to console only
- `DAT-001` — Leave.approve() updates status outside transaction and audit is logger-only
- `DAT-002` — AuditService is logger-only — security events not persisted
- `DAT-007` — Hard-delete of a Project nukes its TimeEntries, ProjectSnapshots, Documents
- `PER-003` — Daily snapshot cron N+1: findFirst per project then create
- `PER-010` — Leave model has ZERO indexes — every leaves query is a seq scan

## Conventions

- **Source files are read-only.** `audits/2026-05-24-adversarial-review.md`, `audits/findings.json`, `audits/agents/*.json`, and `audits/codex-addendum.json` are immutable source of truth. The BACKLOG.md is the workbench; the audit files are the spec.
- **One task = one commit minimum.** The closing commit message must contain `[closes <task-id>]`. The CI gate enforces this mechanically.
- **No phase skipping.** Phase N+1 picks are only allowed when phase N is fully drained (or for phase 13 isolated findings, which can be picked alongside any phase).
- **Verification is a contract.** Tasks marked DONE without the verification command passing are violations.

## Generated metadata

- Generated: 2026-05-24
- Source audit run: 2026-05-24 (6 parallel adversarial sub-agents + Codex cross-review)
- Total findings: 173 + 1 Codex addendum = 174
