## 2026-05-24 — SEC-001 closed (RBAC guard fail-closed by default)

- **Session ID:** 2026-05-24-sec-001
- **Tasks closed:** SEC-001
- **Tasks moved to BLOCKED:** none
- **Commits:** 97e2636 (in_progress anchor), 507d755 (fix), <pending> (closeout)
- **Duration:** ~25 minutes
- **Learnings (non-trivial):**
  - The audit's suggested fix is an OR (default flip OR boot-assert + docs). Implementing both is cheap and the example commit-message shape in `CLAUDE_SESSION_CONTRACT.md` ("enforce RBAC guard default + boot-assert in prod") confirms this is the intended belt-and-suspenders approach.
  - The pre-existing test file already covered the explicit-enforce path. The missing coverage was the env-unset path — which is precisely the regression vector. Always test the default branch, not just the configured branches.
  - `docker-compose.prod.yml` already sets `RBAC_GUARD_MODE: enforce`; the boot-assert hardens against any future deployment that bypasses that compose file.
  - Workflow: stayed on master (per saved "no feature branches" preference) after explicit confirmation; staged only SEC-001 files despite a dirty working tree.
- **Open questions for next session:** none
